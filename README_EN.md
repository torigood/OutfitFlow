## Architecture

### Data Structure

```
Firestore
└── users/{userId}
    └── wardrobe (subcollection)
        ├── {clothingId}
        │   ├── name, category, color, brand
        │   ├── seasons: ["Spring", "Summer"]
        │   ├── imageUrl (Cloudinary CDN)
        │   └── createdAt, updatedAt
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Subcollection Architecture**: User data isolation and scalability
- **Context API**: Global authentication state management
- **Native Optimization**: Optimized UI/UX for iOS/Android platforms
